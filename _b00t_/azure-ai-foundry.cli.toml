# Azure AI Foundry - Enterprise Multi-Agent Orchestration

Azure AI Foundry provides superior multi-agent orchestration capabilities compared to simpler task management tools like TaskMaster.

## Key Advantages Over TaskMaster

### 1. Connected Agents Architecture
- **Hierarchical Delegation**: Primary agents intelligently delegate to specialized sub-agents
- **No Custom Orchestrators**: Natural language routing eliminates hardcoded logic
- **Maximum Depth 2**: Parent agents can have multiple sub-agent siblings
- **Purpose-Built Specialists**: Each sub-agent optimized for specific tasks

### 2. Stateful Multi-Agent Workflows
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains state across complex business processes
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Manages customer onboarding, supply chain automation
- **Enterprise Integration**: Built-in security, observability, audit trails

### 3. Framework Integration
- **Semantic Kernel**: Open-source agent framework extension
- **Protocol Support**: MCP (Model Context Protocol), A2A (Agent2Agent)
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with third-party tools

## Implementation Patterns

### Connected Agents Example
```python
# Primary agent delegates to specialized sub-agents
customer_support_agent = {
    "sub_agents": [
        "technical_support_agent",
        "billing_agent", 
        "escalation_agent"
    ],
    "routing": "natural_language",  # No hardcoded logic needed
    "max_depth": 2
}
```

### Multi-Agent Workflow
```yaml
workflow:
  name: "customer_onboarding"
  agents:
    - content_collector
    - writing_assistant  
    - content_manager
  state_management: true
  context_preservation: true
```

## Enterprise Features

- **Security**: Enterprise-grade authentication and authorization
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and debugging
- **Scalability**: Cloud-native scaling for production workloads
- **Reliability**: Improved error handling and fault tolerance

## Migration from TaskMaster

TaskMaster is suitable for simple task lists but Azure AI Foundry excels at:
- Complex business process automation
- Multi-step workflows requiring context
- Enterprise security and compliance
- Sub-agent specialization and coordination

## Getting Started

1. Install Azure AI Foundry CLI: `b00t cli install azure-ai-foundry`
2. Login to Azure: `az login`
3. Create workspace: `az ai-foundry workspace create`
4. Explore samples: `~/.b00t/foundry-samples`
5. Deploy connected agents: `az ai-foundry agent create --template connected-agents`
