# Azure AI Foundry MCP Server - Enterprise Agent Orchestration

Provides MCP interface to Azure AI Foundry's advanced multi-agent capabilities.

## Advantages Over TaskMaster MCP

### Enterprise Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Connected Agents**: Hierarchical delegation without custom orchestrators
- **Sub-Agent Specialization**: Purpose-built agents for specific business functions
- **Stateful Workflows**: Context preservation across complex business processes
- **Natural Language Routing**: No hardcoded logic for agent coordination

### MCP Integration Capabilities

```typescript
// Connected agents via MCP
await mcp.call("azure_foundry.create_connected_agents", {
  primary_agent: "customer_support_coordinator",
  sub_agents: [
    {
      name: "technical_support",
      specialization: "technical_troubleshooting",
      tools: ["diagnostic_tools", "knowledge_base"]
    },
    {
      name: "billing_agent", 
      specialization: "billing_and_payments",
      tools: ["payment_processor", "billing_system"]
    },
    {
      name: "escalation_agent",
      specialization: "complex_issue_resolution", 
      tools: ["crm_system", "manager_notifications"]
    }
  ],
  routing_strategy: "natural_language",
  max_depth: 2
});

// Stateful multi-agent workflows
await mcp.call("azure_foundry.deploy_workflow", {
  workflow_name: "customer_onboarding",
  agents: ["content_collector", "writing_assistant", "content_manager"],
  state_management: true,
  context_preservation: true,
  enterprise_features: {
    security: "enterprise_grade",
    observability: "comprehensive",
    scalability: "cloud_native"
  }
});
```

## Enterprise Features via MCP

### Security and Compliance
- Azure AD integration for authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC) 
- Audit trails and compliance logging
- Enterprise-grade encryption

### Observability and Monitoring
- Real-time agent performance metrics
- Workflow execution tracing
- Error handling and fault tolerance
- Cost optimization insights

### Scalability and Reliability
- Cloud-native auto-scaling
- Multi-region deployment support
- High availability configurations
- Load balancing for agent workloads

## Migration from TaskMaster

### When to Use TaskMaster
- Simple task lists and project tracking
- Basic PRD parsing
- Single-user workflows
- Development/prototyping phases

### When to Use Azure AI Foundry
- Multi-agent business process automation
- Customer service orchestration
- Complex workflow management
- Enterprise production deployments
- Sub-agent specialization needs
- Stateful context requirements

## Connected Agents Patterns

### Customer Support System
```python
support_system = {
    "primary_agent": "support_coordinator",
    "sub_agents": {
        "technical": "handles_technical_issues",
        "billing": "processes_payment_queries", 
        "escalation": "manages_complex_cases"
    },
    "routing": "intelligent_natural_language",
    "context_sharing": True
}
```

### Content Creation Workflow  
```python
content_workflow = {
    "agents": [
        "content_collector",  # Gathers requirements and research
        "writing_assistant",  # Creates and refines content
        "content_manager"     # Stores, organizes, and publishes
    ],
    "state_management": True,
    "workflow_orchestration": "stateful"
}
```

Azure AI Foundry MCP provides enterprise-ready multi-agent orchestration that scales from prototype to production, replacing TaskMaster for complex business automation needs.
