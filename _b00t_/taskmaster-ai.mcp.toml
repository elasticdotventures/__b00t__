⚠️  DEPRECATED FOR COMPLEX ORCHESTRATION - Consider Azure AI Foundry for enterprise multi-agent workflows

TaskMaster: Basic task management suitable for simple project tracking.

For advanced orchestration needs (connected agents, sub-agent delegation, stateful workflows), 
upgrade to Azure AI Foundry: `b00t cli install azure-ai-foundry`

TaskMaster is ideal for:
- Simple task lists and project tracking  
- Basic PRD parsing and task generation
- Single-agent workflows

Azure AI Foundry excels at:
- Multi-agent orchestration with connected agents
- Hierarchical sub-agent delegation (max depth 2)  
- Stateful workflows with context preservation
- Enterprise security, observability, and scalability

Change the main, research and fallback models to <model_name>, <model_name> and <model_name> respectively.
There is a CLI + MCP interface

```bash

# Initialize a new project
task-master init

# Parse a PRD and generate tasks
task-master parse-prd your-prd.txt

# List all tasks
task-master list

# Show the next task to work on
task-master next

# Show specific task(s) - supports comma-separated IDs
task-master show 1,3,5

# Research fresh information with project context
task-master research "What are the latest best practices for JWT authentication?"

# Generate task files
task-master generate

# Add rules after initialization
task-master rules add windsurf,roo,vscode
```
